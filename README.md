# Friction Particle Electrification Simulator (py_fpes)

This script can simulate the frictional electrification of several particles and store the data in CSV tables.
>**NOTE:** The project is still under development.

>Currently, development files are placed inside the "/pre" directory. When the first stable version is published, the files will be inside the "/release" directory.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions to perform the installation and use the script.

### Prerequisites

To run the script, you will need the following python libraries:

```
pandas, numpy, os
```

Which can be installed using the following commands ([pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) required):

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install os
```

## Installation

>**NOTE:** Since the project does not yet have stable versions, replace the "/release" directory with "/pre" when executing commands.

Clone the [py_fpes](https://github.com/br3n0henrique/py_fpes) repository to your directory:

```bash
cd /mydirectory/
```
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/br3n0henrique/py_fpes.git
```

Make the 'main.py' script executable:

```bash
cd /mydirectory/release/
chmod +x main.py
```

## Usage

>**NOTE:** Since the project does not yet have stable versions, replace the "/release" directory with "/pre" when executing commands.

Just run the 'main.py' script:
```bash
python3 /mydirectory/release/main.py
```
The output tables will be available at the root of the script directory.
